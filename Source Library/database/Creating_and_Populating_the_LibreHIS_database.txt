Hello,

Please take the following steps to create an initial LibreHis database.
For this you need a PostgreSQL database server.

If you have the PostgreSQL database server running on Linux these are the steps you should take:

First create a user that will later own the database:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ createuser -P librehis
Enter password for new role: <Enter a password>
Enter it again: <Enter the same password>
$ createdb -O librehis librehis
$

Now you have an emtpy database and need to create the initial contents.

$ cat librehis-schema.psql | psql -h localhost -U librehis -W
Password for user piet: <Enter the same password>

You now see a lot of output like "CREATE TABLE", "CREATE INDEX", etc.
This will take some time.

Now it is time to fill the database with its initial contents.


$ cat librehis-data.psql | psql -h localhost -U librehis -W
Password for user piet: <Enter the same password>

Again you will see output about the progress.

After this your are done with the setup of the database


Have fun!
